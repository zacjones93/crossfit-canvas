    bio: "I grew up in Caldwell, Idaho, and spent my childhood summers in South Texas, where I was born. I've been married to my husband, Ryan, for 23 years this June, and we have two awesome kiddos, Cash and Presley.\n\nI graduated from Vallivue High School and went on to attend Boise State University.\n\nI enjoy remodeling & home decorating projects in my \"spare\" time. Over the years, I have learned how to build things, knock down walls, remove cabinets hang shiplap, etc. I love it!!\n\nMy family and I are extremely active — you'll find us wakesurfing, hiking & enjoying our pool in the summer, and we love to travel. We're big fans of all things fitness and spend a lot of time cheering on our kids at their sporting events. It's truly the BEST!\n\nI've been a CrossFit coach for six years. When I'm not coaching, I run my own retail and custom t-shirt business, G4 Collective.\n\nWhat I love most about coaching is getting to be a part of someone's day for an hour & making those connections. It's an honor to show up, encourage them, and hopefully leave them feeling stronger and happier than when they walked in.\n\nLooking ahead, I'm currently working toward my CrossFit Level 2 certification. I'm also passionate about furthering my education in women's health/fitness — especially for women 40 and over. It's so important for women in this stage of life to continue building and maintaining muscle through weight training and nutrition.",
